Icons for external tools (e.g. Travis)

Short description explaining (1) what the repo contains, (2) how it works and (3) why you would need it.

This repository contains declaration files in the [Postman](https://postman.com/) format. The files are automatically generated based on the latest [adyen-openapi](https://github.com/adyen/adyen-openapi) definition files.
They are then uploaded on our [AdyenDev](https://www.postman.com/adyendev/) Postman space and you can fork it from there. You can also directly pick the `.json` files available here and upload them if you prefer.

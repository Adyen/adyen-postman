# AdyenDev Release Notes

The AdyenDev Postman space helps developers to explore, integrate and test the Adyen APIs.  

This page contains the **Release Notes** of the following resources:
* [Adyen APIs](#adyen-apis)
* [Adyen in-person payments](#adyen-in-person-payments)
* [Adyen Postman Flows](#adyen-postman-flows)

## Adyen APIs

> All Adyen APIs with documentation, variables and examples. See on [Postman](https://www.postman.com/adyendev/workspace/adyen-apis/overview).

### Nov 2023
- The path variables are defined using the Postman conventions, for example `/paymentLinks/:linkId`. This allows to set the value of the path parameter without editing the URL.  
- The endpoints within a folder are ordered alphabetically.  

### Sept 2023
- The path variables (i.e. `/action/{id}`) are no longer defined as environment variables. Edit them directly in the endpoint URL for more flexibility, enabling the testing of various scenarios and entities.

### Feb 2023
- First release: creation of the workspace and all Postman collections.
